# This file contains a tab-separated list of controls for running parse_files.py.  The format is 
# [keyword](tab)[value]

# The directory the SNP files are found in.  If "." or unspecified, the current directory is used.
DIR	C:\OpenSNP

# The names of the SNP file to process.  If unspecified, all files are processed.
# The structure allows multiple groups of files since we may want to compare groups that display two 
# different phenotypes.  The prefix is FILES + : + priority + : + label.  The value is a comma-separated
# list of file selectors with wildcards allowed.  For example:
#    FILES:Tongue Rollers:1 user894_*.txt,user895*.txt,user896*.txt,user897*.txt
#    FILES:Non-Tongue Rollers:2 user898*.txt,user899*.txt
#    FILES:Unknown:3 *.txt
# This example compares three groups of files labeled "Tongue Rollers", "Non-Tongue Rollers" and "Unknown".
# The files for each list are users whose phenotypes show that they belong in one of the first two categories or, 
# for the last category, all files that don't fit into one of the first two groups.
# The priority controls the order of selection.  The third group is a wildcard, so it includes all ".txt" files that
# weren't already selected for one of the first two groups.
FILES:Group 1:1	user10_*.txt, user11_*.txt, user13_*.txt, user14_*.txt
FILES:Group 2:2	user20_*.txt, user22_*.txt, user26_*.txt

# The RSID to search for int The file.  If unspecified or "*", all RSIDs are processed.
RSID	RS10403190

#
# Note:  IYG files contain no chromosome or position so don't use these four options when parsing IYG.
#
# The starting chromosome to process.  If unspecified, all up to the CHROMEND# are processed
CHROMSTART	

# The last chromosome to process.  If unspecified, all starting with CHROMSTART# are processed
CHROMEND	

# The starting position on the chromosome to process.  If unspecified, all positions up to the END# are processed
POSSTART	

# The last position on the chromosome to process.  If unspecified, all positions starting with START# are processed
POSEND	

# 
# Note: These three options just control progress output 
#
# If true, show the names of selected files and of files with no data to process that passes the selections in this file
SHOWSELECTEDFILES	T

# If true, show the progress of files as we process each
SHOWFILEPROGRESS	T

# If specified, show the progress of files and the lines in them each time we process another set of that many lines
SHOWPROGRESS#LINES	100000
