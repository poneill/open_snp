* Overview
  The purpose of this file is to collect notes about the structure of
  the data.

* SNP data
: {user:{rsid:[(chromosome,start,stop,genotype)]}}
  That is, each user has a set of rsids.  Each rsid is associated with
  a /list/ of tuples (chromosome, start, stop, genotype), since the
  rsid is not unique.

* Phenotype
: {user:{phenotype:value}}
  Each user has a value for each phenotype, assuming =None= is an
  admissible value.

[{phenotype:{phenotype:name, phenotype_id:value,data:{user_id:id,value:value}}}]
 A list of phenotypes each having a name and id, each phenotype has a list of users that have responded and have a value other than "-" for the phenotype
