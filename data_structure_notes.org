* Overview
  The purpose of this file is to collect notes about the structure of
  the data.

* SNP data
: {user:{rsid:[(chromosome,start,stop,genotype)]}}
  That is, each user has a set of rsids.  Each rsid is associated with
  a /list/ of tuples (chromosome, start, stop, genotype), since the
  rsid is not unique.

* Phenotype
: {user:{phenotype:value}}
  Each user has a value for each phenotype, assuming =None= is an
  admissible value.
